## 🔒 Security

### RLS Policies
- ✅ Users can only see their own businesses
- ✅ Users can only create businesses for themselves
- ✅ Users can only update their own businesses
- ✅ Users can only delete their own businesses

### Auth Guards
- ✅ Login/Signup pages redirect if already logged in
- ✅ Dashboard redirects to login if not authenticated
- ✅ Department pages check for workspace
- ✅ Onboarding only accessible when logged in

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Mobile won't scroll
- Clear cache
- Verify waves-background.tsx has `passive: true`
- Check no other elements blocking touch

### Onboarding shows "Not authenticated"
- Should be fixed (using getSession now)
- If persists: clear localStorage and cookies
- Check Supabase connection

### Redirect loop
- Should be fixed (login → dashboard flow)
- Clear localStorage
- Sign out and back in

### Navbar shows email
- User needs to complete onboarding first
- Onboarding saves name to user_metadata
- Sign out and back in to refresh

### Business creation fails
- Check database migration ran
- Verify RLS policies exist
- Check backend API is running
- Check Supabase logs
