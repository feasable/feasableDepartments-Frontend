# üö® URGENT FIX GUIDE - Onboarding & Login Issues

## üî¥ Root Causes Identified

Based on your console logs, there are **2 critical issues** preventing your app from working:

### Issue 1: No Internet Connection
```
GET https://zoqqrvmfumzfnhdrgjyk.supabase.co/auth/v1/user net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED
```

**Your computer lost internet connection during testing.**

### Issue 2: Backend API Not Running
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Your app is trying to connect to `http://localhost:8080` but **your backend server is not running**.

---

## ‚úÖ FIXES - Do These 3 Steps IN ORDER

### Step 1: Fix Your Internet Connection

**CHECK:**
1. Open a new browser tab
2. Try to visit https://google.com
3. If it doesn't load, you're offline

**FIX:**
- Reconnect to WiFi
- Check your router
- Restart your network adapter

**VERIFY:**
- Visit https://zoqqrvmfumzfnhdrgjyk.supabase.co/auth/v1/health
- You should see a response (not an error)

---

### Step 2: Start Your Backend Server

Your frontend is configured to talk to `http://localhost:8080` but nothing is listening there.

**Option A: Start Your Backend (Recommended)**

```bash
# Navigate to your backend directory
cd path/to/your/backend

# Start the server
npm run dev
# or
node server.js
# or whatever command starts your backend
```

**Option B: Use Production Backend (If Available)**

If you have a deployed backend, update `.env.local`:

```bash
# Change from:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# To your production URL:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.luno.org
```

**Option C: Work Without Backend (Temporary)**

If you don't have a backend yet, we need to modify the onboarding to work without it.

---

### Step 3: Restart Your Frontend

After fixing internet and backend:

```bash
# Stop your Next.js dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Clear the cache
npm run build
# or just restart

# Start again
npm run dev
```

---

## üîç Why You're Seeing These Errors

### "Please log in to complete your profile"

This happens because:
1. Supabase can't verify your session (no internet)
2. The session check fails
3. The onboarding wizard thinks you're not logged in

```typescript
// From OnboardingWizard.tsx line 67-69
const { data: { session }, error: sessionError } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
if (sessionError || !session?.user) {
  throw new Error('Please log in to complete your profile') // üëà This error
}
```

**Fix:** Ensure internet is connected so Supabase can verify your session.

---

### "Loading..." Flash Loop on Dashboard

This happens because:
1. Dashboard tries to fetch user data from backend
2. Backend at `localhost:8080` doesn't respond (not running)
3. Request fails ‚Üí redirects to login
4. Login detects you're logged in ‚Üí redirects to dashboard
5. **LOOP REPEATS** ‚ôªÔ∏è

```
Dashboard ‚Üí API call fails ‚Üí Redirect to /login ‚Üí Already logged in ‚Üí Redirect to /dashboard ‚Üí ...
```

**Fix:** Start your backend server so API calls succeed.

## üß™ Testing After Fixes

### Test 1: Internet Connection
```bash
# In PowerShell or CMD
ping google.com

# Should see replies, not "Request timed out"
```

### Test 2: Backend Server
```bash
# In PowerShell or browser
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# or visit http://localhost:8080 in browser

# Should see a response, not "Connection refused"
```

### Test 3: Supabase Connection
Visit this in your browser:
```
https://zoqqrvmfumzfnhdrgjyk.supabase.co/auth/v1/health
```

Should return: `{"date":"...", "version":"..."}`

## üìã Quick Checklist

Before testing the app again:

- [ ] Internet is connected (can visit google.com)
- [ ] Backend server is running (http://localhost:8080 responds)
- [ ] Supabase is accessible (health endpoint works)
- [ ] Next.js dev server restarted after changes
- [ ] Browser cache cleared (Ctrl+F5 or hard refresh)

## üÜò If Issues Persist

### Still seeing "Please log in" during onboarding?

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Clear all storage:
   - Cookies
   - LocalStorage
   - SessionStorage
   - IndexedDB
4. Refresh page (F5)
5. Try signup/login again

### Still seeing login flash loop?

Check console for this specific error:
```
Error ensuring user business: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

If you see this, your backend is STILL not responding. Verify:
```bash
# Check if something is listening on port 8080
netstat -an | findstr "8080"

# Should show: TCP 0.0.0.0:8080 LISTENING
```

### Backend doesn't exist yet?

If you don't have a backend API, we need to modify the code to work without it. Let me know and I'll provide the changes.

## üìû Need More Help?

Share these specific details:
1. Can you visit google.com? (Yes/No)
2. Is your backend running? (Yes/No/Don't have one)
3. What do you see when you visit http://localhost:8080 in browser?
4. Screenshot of browser Network tab showing the failed requests

---

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ‚úÖ No `ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` in console
- ‚úÖ No `Failed to fetch` errors
- ‚úÖ Onboarding completes without "Please log in" error
- ‚úÖ Dashboard loads without flash loop
- ‚úÖ Name appears in navbar (not email)
- ‚úÖ Anonymous sign-in is **NOT NEEDED** (disable it - it's a security risk)

---

**Start with Step 1 (Internet) and work through each step in order. The errors you're seeing are all downstream effects of these two root causes.**
