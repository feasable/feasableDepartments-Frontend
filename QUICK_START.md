## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "user_profiles table doesn't exist"
- Did you run `/database/schema.sql` in Supabase?
- Check Table Editor to verify

### "Can't sign up"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase URL & keys in `.env.local`
- Make sure Supabase project is active

### "OAuth not working"
- Did you enable providers in Supabase?
- Are redirect URLs correct?
- Try in incognito mode

### "Build warning about Three.js"
- This is expected and harmless
- App works fine in production
- See `STATUS_REPORT.md` for details
