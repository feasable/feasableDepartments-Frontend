## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### "Not authenticated" error
**Should be fixed, but if it happens:**
1. Clear browser cookies and localStorage
2. Sign out completely
3. Sign in again
4. Check browser console for errors

### Redirect loop
**Should be fixed, but if it happens:**
1. Clear localStorage
2. Check you ran database migration
3. Verify you're on latest code
4. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Mobile won't scroll
**Should be fixed, but if it happens:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try incognito mode
3. Test on different device/browser

### Business creation fails
1. Check database migration ran
